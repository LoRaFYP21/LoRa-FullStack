Multi-hop LoRa networks for communication in disasters have emerged as a crucial technology in the field of resilient and decentralized wireless communication systems. Disasters such as earthquakes, floods, landslides, tsunamis, and cyclones often cause the failure of traditional telecommunication infrastructure including cellular towers, fiber backbones, and power grids, resulting in the loss of connectivity exactly when communication is most critical. In such emergency scenarios, rapid and reliable exchange of information between rescue teams, command centers, and affected civilians is vital for efficient disaster response and recovery. LoRa (Long Range) technology, which operates using chirp spread spectrum (CSS) modulation, is particularly well-suited for these environments because it offers long-range communication (up to 15–20 km in rural areas), ultra-low power consumption, and robust resistance to interference and fading. However, conventional LoRaWAN deployments use a single-hop star topology, where all end devices communicate directly with a centralized gateway. This approach severely limits coverage, reliability, and scalability in disaster-affected or remote regions, since the failure of a single gateway can isolate an entire cluster of nodes. To overcome these limitations, researchers and engineers have introduced multi-hop LoRa networks, where intermediate nodes act as relays to forward packets toward a destination or gateway. This forms a mesh or ad hoc topology, enabling messages to traverse multiple hops and dynamically reconfigure routes based on link availability, signal strength, or node energy. In essence, a multi-hop network transforms LoRa from a simple sensor system into a self-organizing, self-healing communication fabric that can cover vast, infrastructure-free regions. In the aftermath of a disaster, such a network can be deployed using portable LoRa relay nodes powered by batteries or small solar panels to instantly connect isolated regions to command centers or relief camps. Each relay node can serve as both a data collector and a forwarder, ensuring that critical messages such as distress calls, environmental measurements, or GPS coordinates are successfully propagated even when some nodes are damaged or out of range. These networks can be designed to support diverse use cases such as rescue team coordination, structural health monitoring (SHM) of bridges and buildings, environmental hazard sensing (for example gas leaks, water levels, or fire detection), and emergency alert broadcasting. For example, a network of LoRa-equipped sensor nodes placed in a floodplain can continuously monitor water levels and relay early warning data to a control station via multiple hops. Similarly, wearable LoRa devices on rescue workers can track their real-time positions and vital signs, allowing operation centers to manage search and rescue missions more effectively. The inherent long-range and low-power nature of LoRa makes it ideal for such deployments, enabling devices to operate for months or even years on small batteries while covering tens of kilometers without requiring existing cellular or Wi-Fi infrastructure. Nevertheless, building an efficient multi-hop LoRa network presents significant technical challenges. Routing protocols must be lightweight, adaptive, and energy-efficient since LoRa nodes typically have limited computational and energy resources. Protocols such as AODV (Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector), RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks), ETX-based path selection, or custom geographic routing schemes are often evaluated for this purpose. Additionally, maintaining a balance between packet delivery ratio (PDR), end-to-end latency, throughput, and energy consumption requires careful optimization of parameters such as spreading factor (SF), bandwidth (BW), coding rate (CR), transmission power, and duty cycle constraints imposed by regional regulations such as the 1% duty cycle in AS923 or EU868 bands. Collisions and interference can further reduce performance, especially when multiple nodes transmit simultaneously in overlapping frequency bands. Therefore, intelligent scheduling, adaptive data rates (ADR), and time-division mechanisms are often incorporated to enhance reliability. To analyze and optimize the performance of these systems before deployment, simulation tools such as OMNeT++ with frameworks like FLoRa and INET are extensively used. Through such simulations, engineers can evaluate network scalability, link quality, and energy efficiency across large-scale topologies such as 60 km × 60 km grids with hundreds of relay and end nodes. Metrics such as packet delivery ratio (PDR), latency and jitter, throughput, airtime, duty-cycle utilization, routing path length, and energy per bit (J/bit) are analyzed to understand trade-offs under different configurations. Studies often reveal that while continuous high-rate data streaming, for example raw sensor data at 200 Hz, is infeasible due to bandwidth and duty-cycle limitations, feature-based periodic packets combined with event-triggered bursts provide a highly efficient compromise for reliable multi-hop operation. From a practical perspective, multi-hop LoRa networks can be deployed using off-the-shelf hardware platforms such as LilyGO LoRa32 or Heltec ESP32 boards integrated with SX127x transceivers. These nodes can be programmed to form mesh networks, acting as relay and end nodes with GPS modules, OLED displays, and sensors. Gateways or controller units, often based on Raspberry Pi devices, can manage and visualize network data, while mobile phones can serve as temporary gateways via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi bridging. When integrated with cloud dashboards or offline databases, these systems can provide situational awareness even in the absence of internet connectivity. In conclusion, multi-hop LoRa networks represent a cost-effective, energy-efficient, and highly resilient solution for emergency communication in disaster-stricken regions. By leveraging the simplicity and robustness of LoRa with intelligent multi-hop routing and decentralized operation, they can sustain critical communication links where all conventional systems fail. Their flexibility, scalability, and compatibility with low-cost hardware make them a powerful foundation for future disaster-resilient communication ecosystems, ensuring that life-saving information can always find its way through, no matter how severe the disaster.
