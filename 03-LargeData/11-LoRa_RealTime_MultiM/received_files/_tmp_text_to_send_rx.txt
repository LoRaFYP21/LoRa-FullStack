A LoRa-based communication system is crucial after disasters because it enables long-range, low-power wireless communication in environments where traditional networks may be down. LoRa (Long Range) technology allows devices to transmit small amounts of data over several kilometers, even in remote or disaster-affected areas. This makes it ideal for coordinating rescue operations, tracking survivors, and sharing critical information without relying on damaged infrastructure. Its low energy consumption also ensures long-lasting communication, which is vital when power sources are limited.
